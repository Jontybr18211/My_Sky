API Key Configuration
This project requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data. The application uses the One Call API 3.0, which is available under their free plan.

How to Get Your API Key
Sign Up: Create a free account on OpenWeatherMap.

Subscribe to One Call API: After logging in, go to the One Call API 3.0 page and click the "Get API key and subscribe" button in the "Free" plan section.

Generate Key: Navigate to the API keys tab in your user dashboard. Your default key should be listed here. You can generate additional keys if needed.

Copy the Key: Copy the generated API key. It may take a few minutes to become active.

How to Use Your API Key
The application loads the API key from a .env file.

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project (the same folder as main.py).

Add your API key to the .env file in the following format:

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Replace your_api_key_here with the key you copied from the OpenWeatherMap dashboard. The .gitignore file is already configured to prevent this file from being uploaded to GitHub.

Usage
Once the setup is complete and the API key is configured, run the application with the following command:

python main.py
